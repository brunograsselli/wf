# wf (workflow)

I used to have a few ruby/shell scripts to automate some of my workflow tasks (e.g. starting a new task). I'm porting them to a tool written in golang.

## Usage
```

Usage:
  wf [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  pr          Open a new pull request
  push        Push to remote (setup upstream)
  start       Start a new ticket

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for wf

Use "wf [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
